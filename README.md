# CLI-Password-Manager

A command-line-based Password Manager built with Python, designed for secure password storage, retrieval, and generation. This project leverages SQLite for data storage and the `cryptography` library for encryption, ensuring your passwords are stored securely.

## Features

- **Master Password Protection**: Access to the password manager is secured by a master password.
- **Secure Encryption**: Passwords are encrypted using the `Fernet` encryption from the `cryptography` library.
- **Password Generation**: Easily generate strong passwords with customizable character sets and lengths.
- **Password Management**:
  - Save passwords for different services.
  - View stored passwords in a tabulated format.
  - Delete passwords by service name.
- **Clipboard Support**: Automatically copy generated passwords to your clipboard.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Command-line menus for easy navigation and management.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- `Python 3.8` or higher
- `pip` (Python package manager)
- `venv` module (usually included with Python, but ensure it is installed if missing)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/m3l-hach/CLI-Password-Manager.git
   cd CLI-Password-Manager
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install `pyinstaller`**:
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

4. **Build the executable**:
   Run the following command in the root directory of the project:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile \
               --runtime-tmpdir "$HOME/.password_manager" \
               --name "PasswordManager" \
               --distpath ./bin \
               --paths ./password_manager password_manager/main.py
   ```

5. **Clean up unnecessary files** (Optional):
   After building the executable, you can remove the `build/` directory and the `.spec` file generated by PyInstaller to keep your project directory clean:
   ```bash
   rm -rf build PasswordManager.spec
   ```

6. **Add to PATH** (Optional):
   To use the password manager from anywhere in your terminal, add the `bin/` directory to your `PATH` environment variable:
   ```bash
   export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)/bin"  # Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc for persistence
   ```

7. **Backup recommendation**:
   The program stores its data in the `~/.password_manager` directory. This directory is created automatically when you first run the program. It is highly recommended to periodically back up this directory to prevent data loss.

8. **Run the executable**:
   ```bash
   ./bin/PasswordManager  # On Windows: bin\PasswordManager.exe
   ```

## Notes

- Ensure the master password is strong and not easily guessable.
- Regularly back up the `~/.password_manager` directory to avoid data loss.
- Use the provided executable for the best user experience.
